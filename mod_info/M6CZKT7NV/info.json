    "message": "[B][SIZE=6]Mod Conflict Resolver[\/SIZE][\/B]\n\nEver had one mod overwrite another? Missing features because two mods touched the same files? [B]This tool fixes that.[\/B]\n\n[SIZE=4][U] What It Does[\/U][\/SIZE]\n\nThis mod automatically detects and resolves conflicts between active mods that try to edit the same files\u2014like keyboard binding configs (`.json`) or behavior scripts (`.lua`).\n\n[SIZE=4][U] Key Features[\/U][\/SIZE]\n\n[LIST]\n[*][B]Finds Conflicts:[\/B] Scans all active mods for duplicate file paths (e.g., `\/vehicles\/etki\/input_actions.json`).\n[*][B]Smart Merging:[\/B]\n[LIST]\n[*]Performs [I]deep merges[\/I] of conflicting [B]JSON files[\/B], such as custom keybinds. If two mods add different bindings to the same car, you\u2019ll get [B]both[\/B].\n[*]Analyzes and merges [B]Lua scripts[\/B], combining logic from different mods (for supported vehicle script patterns).\n[\/LIST]\n[*][B]Creates a New Merged Mod:[\/B] Saves the result to `[I]\/mods\/ModConflictResolutions\/[\/I]`, which loads as a high-priority patch.\n[*][B]Automatic and Background Friendly:[\/B] Re-evaluates conflicts every time you enable\/disable a mod.\n[\/LIST]\n\n[SIZE=4][U] Example[\/U][\/SIZE]\n\nSay one mod adds a custom horn keybind to a car, and another mod adds a boost activation keybind. Normally, the last mod loaded would overwrite the other\u2014[B]you\u2019d lose one feature[\/B]. With this resolver, [B]both bindings are preserved and fully functional[\/B].\n[ATTACH=full]1244182[\/ATTACH]\n\n[SIZE=4][U] Installation[\/U][\/SIZE]\n\nJust install like a normal mod\u2014no setup needed. It will start resolving conflicts as soon as it\u2019s enabled.\n\n[SIZE=4][U] TLDR [\/U][\/SIZE]\n\nThis tool is a must-have for heavy mod users or developers who want maximum compatibility. It keeps the game stable and makes sure no good feature goes to waste.",
